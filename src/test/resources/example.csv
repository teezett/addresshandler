#This is an example, what an csv file should look like

# As you might have guessed, empty lines, or lines starting with a hash mark
# are ignored

# This here is a confline (you can have multiple of these in one file). A
# confline is an @sv line (well, the comma is already in use ;-) ). The
# first entry is the name of the key attribute, the next one is the 
# containername, all following ones will resolve into objectclasses.
@uid@dc=mymorg, dc=com@top@person@posixAccount

# The next line is the about line, I think you can guess, what it is
# needed for.

# Finally, the real data:
# patrick, a normal user (note the linebreak in the description field)
"patrick","{CRYPT}foobar","/home/patrick","500","100","Patrick Ahlbrecht","El
programmer","/bin/bash"

# root has some empty values
"root","GueZTh1z","/root","0","0",,,"/bin/sh"

# And here is one entry, having more fields than permitted.

"nobody","x",,,,,,,,,,,"surplus field","me too","me three"
